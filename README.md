# 🚀 Universal Dev Registry

**The Central Nervous System for Developer Tools & Packages**

## 🧠 What is Universal Dev Registry?

The **Universal Dev Registry** is built to solve the fragmentation of the developer ecosystem.

Instead of scraping the internet for the right `winget`, `brew`, or `npm` commands, we provide a **unified interface** to discover, select, and install everything you need to start coding in seconds.

---

## 💡 Why Universal Dev Registry?

Modern development involves juggling multiple package managers and system tools.  
We provide a **single space** to manage them all.

### ⚡ One-Stop Tooling

Find **system-level software** (Node.js, MongoDB Compass, VS Code) alongside **library-level packages** (React, FastAPI, GORM) in one search.

### 🛠️ Cross-Platform Commands

Select your tools and instantly generate the correct CLI command for your OS:

- **Windows** → Winget  
- **macOS** → Homebrew  
- **Linux** → APT  

### 📦 Unified Deployment Buffer

Queue multiple packages from different ecosystems (**NPM, PyPI, Go, Ruby, etc.**) and install them with **one copy-paste command**.

### 🚧 The Future: Dependency Hell Resolution

We are building a **massive compatibility database**.

Once complete, the registry won’t just help you find packages —  
it will **warn you about version conflicts before you install them**.

## 🛠️ The Ecosystem

The Universal Dev Registry operates across **three specialized components**:

### 🌐 Web Client (Live)

A high-performance **Next.js** interface for rapid package discovery and command generation.

### 🧰 OS Tools Repository

A curated collection of **system-level developer tools**.  
Want to add more tools like **MongoDB Compass** or **Node.js**?

➡️ Check out our **Cross-Platform Dev Tools Repository**

### 🧬 The Matrix API (Private)

A backend engine handling:
- Semantic version resolution  
- Compatibility analysis  
- Future dependency-hell prevention logic

## 🤝 Community & Support

We’re actively looking for **developers and sponsors** to help grow the ecosystem.

### Contribute Tools
Have a tool every developer should have? Add it to the Cross-Platform Registry.

### Report Data Inconsistencies
Help refine our compatibility logic by reporting real-world version conflicts.

## 👤 About the Project

**Universal Dev Registry** is an ambitious effort to streamline the developer experience, built and maintained by **Ambastha-Org**.

> We believe developers should spend their time **writing code**, not fighting with installers and version conflicts.
